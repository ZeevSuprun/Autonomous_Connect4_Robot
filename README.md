# Autonomous_Connect4_Robot

The dipSwitches folder contains a sketch that reads from the dip switches and nothing else. 
The grid_sensing_array folder contains a sketch that takes input from the grid sensors and nothing else. 
The two differentialSteering folders contain versions of differentialSteering.
line_followerOld contains a script that combines grid sensing and differential steering in order to (attempt to) line follow. This script is now deprecated. 

The purpose of the above code was to test new features before adding them to the main program, which is in the line_follower folder.

the line_follower folder contains everything responsible for controlling the actual autonomous connect 4 robot.
